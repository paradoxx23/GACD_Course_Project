#GACD_Course_Project
##Summary
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera. The R script run_analysis.R in this repo meets the following project requirements: 
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Contents
This repo includes the following elements:
  1. run_analysis.R - R script which completes the course requirements noted above
  2. Codebook.md - Decription of the original data set and process used to summarize data into tidy data set
  3. tidy.txt - The tidy data set which is the output of the run_analysis.R script
  4. README.md - This readme file
  
##Data set
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked below was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
